## 💡 Introduction
#### Introducing the three stages of Google Search[^1]
Google Search works in three stages, and not all pages make it through each stage:
* Crawling: Google downloads text, images, and videos from pages it found on the internet with automated programs called crawlers.
* Indexing: Google analyzes the text, images, and video files on the page, and stores the information in the Google index, which is a large database.
* Serving search results: When a user searches on Google, Google returns information that's relevant to the user's query.
