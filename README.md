## 💡 Introduction

#### Introducing the three stages of Google Search[^1]

Google Search works in three stages, and not all pages make it through each stage:

* Indexing: Google analyzes the text, images, and video files on the page, and stores the information in the Google index, which is a large database.
* Serving search results: When a user searches on Google, Google returns information that's relevant to the user's query.
