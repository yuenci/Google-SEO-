When an unexpected error occurs, throwing and catching exceptions can help prevent application crashes and provide valuable information for debugging. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Java.1. Use specific exception classes: Instead of catching general exceptions like Exception or RuntimeException, catch specific exceptions that accurately describe the problem. This allows for more targeted error handling and better logging.2. Handle exceptions gracefully: When an exception is caught, handle it gracefully by providing meaningful error messages, logging the error, and possibly retrying the operation.3. Use try-with-resources: When working with resources like files, streams, or database connections, use try-with-resources statements to automatically close them after use, even if an exception occurs.4. Log exceptions: Logging exceptions is crucial for debugging and diagnosing issues in production. Use a logging framework like Log4j or Java Util Logging to log exceptions along with contextual information like the current thread, user, and timestamp.5. Use checked exceptions sparingly: Checked exceptions can lead to boilerplate code and obscure the main logic of your application. Use them sparingly and only when you expect the caller to handle the exception.By following these best practices, you can write more robust and maintainable Java code that handles errors gracefully and prevents application crashes.\nIntroduction to Java Streams\nException handling is a crucial aspect of writing reliable and maintainable Java code.
