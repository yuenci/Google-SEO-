# Introduction to Java Streams


Java Streams are a powerful feature introduced in Java 8 that allows developers to process collections of data in a functional style. Streams provide a declarative and concise way of expressing data processing pipelines, making it easier to write efficient and maintainable code.

A Stream is a sequence of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially. Streams can be created from collections, arrays, or I/O operations. Once a stream is created, you can use various intermediate and terminal operations to transform, filter, or aggregate the elements in the stream.

Intermediate operations are operations that transform a stream into another stream. Examples include map, filter, and flatMap. Terminal operations are operations that produce a result or a side effect. Examples include forEach, reduce, and collect.

Streams are designed to be lazy, meaning that intermediate operations do not execute until a terminal operation is called. This allows for efficient processing of large collections of data, as only the necessary elements are processed.

Java Streams are also designed to support parallel processing. By using the parallelStream method instead of the stream method, you can process the elements in a stream in parallel, taking advantage of multi-core processors to improve performance.

In conclusion, Java Streams are a powerful and efficient way of processing collections of data in a functional style. By using Streams, you can write more expressive and maintainable code that takes advantage of modern hardware to improve performance.
